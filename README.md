# DAY 1

## Questions :  
• Print the multiplication table of a given number n. A multiplication table for a number n is a list of products of n with integers from 1 to 10.  
• Find the largest digit in a given number n.  
• Write a program that demonstrates encapsulation by creating a class Employee. The class should have private attributes to store:  
  Employee ID.  
  Employee Name.  
  Employee Salary.  
• Write a program to calculate the area of different shapes using function overloading. Implement overloaded functions to compute the area of a circle, a rectangle, and a triangle.  
• Design a C++ program using polymorphism to calculate the area of different shapes:  
  A Rectangle (Area = Length × Breadth).  
  A Circle (Area = π × Radius²).  
  A Triangle (Area = ½ × Base × Height).  
  Create a base class Shape with a pure virtual function getArea(). Use derived classes Rectangle, Circle, and Triangle to override this function.
